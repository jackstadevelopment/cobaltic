# Cobaltic Help + FAQ

## How do I use Cobaltic? 
Use the section below to get a manifest ID of your choice and copy + paste it into Cobaltic and choose a folder to save the game client to.

## What is a manifest?
Manifests are files used to tell the Epic Games Launcher how and where to download games. We use the manifest IDs you provide and give them to splash, which will download the game similar to how EGL does. You can the respected repositories below to get any (mostly) Fortnite version from the past. 

## Where do I get manifest IDs?
You can get Manifest IDs from these repositories:

* [polynite/fn-releases](https://github.com/polynite/fn-releases)

* [VastBlast/FortniteManifestArchive](https://github.com/VastBlast/FortniteManifestArchive)

These can be used with Cobaltic to download game files.
