# Cobaltic v2

Cobaltic v2 is on the way. With a new, more intuitive UI that is more inline with Jacksta Development services. Coming later will be a custom native downloader and will eventually replace Splash. Rewritten in TypeScript and Rust (CRA + Tauri) for cross-platform support if that is ever required. UI sneak peek coming soon.
